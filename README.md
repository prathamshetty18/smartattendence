smart attendence system
Welcome to our Smart Attendance System UI Prototype demonstration!
This video showcases the interface we designed for a modern and efficient attendance-marking system. You can explore the live prototype here:

Our prototype visually represents how a facial-verification-based attendance system can function. Built entirely using HTML, this UI includes sections for:

✔ Webcam Preview
✔ Uploaded ID Photo
✔ Verification Status
✔ Attendance Log
✔ Control Buttons like Start Camera, Capture, Upload ID, and Verify Face

The goal of this prototype is to demonstrate the structure, flow, and design of a smart attendance system. This version contains no backend or functional logic — it is created purely as a UI mockup for presentation and future integration.

This video walks you through the layout, the user journey, and how the final system could look once real facial-verification technology is added.
